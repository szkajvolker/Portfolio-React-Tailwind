  "My name is Istvan Szabo, I am a frontend developer.A bit about me: after high school I explored different career paths in various jobs. In 2019, I moved to Northern Ireland to work. After spending several years in factories, I decided to pursue something I truly enjoy - frontend development. I enrolled in the Codecool bootcamp, where I gained a solid foundation in Javascript, CSS and HTML. I really enjoy programming and constantly challenging myself to grow. In my freetime I like playing videogames, watching TV series and as a hobby, I am also passionate about game development. I am currently following a course in Unreal Engine 5, hoping that one day I can create my own indie game (or at least build one for myself).";
